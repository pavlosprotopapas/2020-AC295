<h2>AC 209c Advanced Practical Data Science</h2>

<p>Welcome to AC209c, Advanced Practical Data Science. This course is the third of a series after AC209a and AC209b. The course focuses on practical data science skills and will teach you how to go beyond prototyping toy models to real deployable models. </p>
<p>The material of the course is divided into 3 modules:</p>
<p>1) How to scale a model from a prototype (often in jupyter notebooks) to the cloud. In this module, we cover virtual environments, containers, and virtual machines before learning about microservices and Kubernetes. Along the way, you  will be exposed to Dask.</p>
<p>2) How to use existing models for transfer learning. Transfer learning is a machine learning method where a model developed for a task is reused as the starting point for a model on a second task. It is a popular approach in deep learning where pre-trained models are used as the starting point on computer vision and natural language processing tasks. This can be very important, given the vast compute and time resources required to develop neural network models on these problems and given the huge jumps in skill that these models can provide to related problems. In this part of the course we will examine various pre-existing models and techniques in transfer learning.</p>
<p>3) In the third part we will be introducing a number of intuitive visualization tools for investigating properties and diagnosing issues of  models. We will be demonstrating a number of visualization tools ranging from the well established (like saliency maps) to recent ones.  </p>

<h3>Prerequisites</h3>

<p>You are expected to have programming experience at the level of CS 50 or above, statistics knowledge at the level of Stat 110 or above, basic data science (or machine learning) at the level of AC209A and AC209B. </p>
<h3>Software</h3>

<p>We will be using a variety of software primarily Python 3. More details in class.</p>
<h3>Course Activities</h3>

<p>The course is structured in two different types of activities that repeat themselves each week and they are: Lectures, Labs.</p>

<p><img alt="alt_text" src="images/Syllabus0.jpg" title="image_tooltip"></p>
<h5>**Lectures**</h5>

<p>The class consists of two weekly lectures. Lectures are held Tues 4:30 pm ‐ 6:30 pm (to be discussed).  At the beginning of each class we will review the one from previous week, followed by the one from the current and in-class exercise to assess your understanding of the material and to help us identify gaps. Attendance to lectures is mandatory. </p>
<p><strong>Labs</strong></p>
<p>Labs are designed as hands-on in-class activities (both groups and individuals). The instructor will go over practice problems and review difficult material. Attendance at labs is mandatory. Lab sessions are held on Thursday from 4:30 pm ‐ 6:30 pm.</p>

<h5>**Accommodations for Students with Disabilities**</h5>

<p>Students needing academic adjustments or accommodations because of a documented disability must present their Faculty Letter from the <a href="http://www.aeo.fas.harvard.edu/">Accessible Education Office</a> (AEO) and speak with Kevin by the end of the third week of the term: Friday, September 15. Failure to do so may result in us being unable to respond in a timely manner. All discussions will remain confidential.</p>
<h5>**Diversity and Inclusion Statement**</h5>

<p>Data Science, like many fields of science, has historically only been represented by a small sliver of the population. This is despite some of the early computer scientist pioneers being women (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ada_Lovelace">Ada Lovelace</a> and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grace_Hopper">Grace Hopper</a> for two examples). Recent initiatives have attempted to overcome some barriers to entry: <a href="https://www.madewithcode.com/">Made /w Code</a>.</p>
<p>We would like to attempt to discuss diversity in data science from time to time where appropriate and possible. Please contact us (in person or electronically) or submit anonymous feedback if you have any suggestions to improve the diversity of the course materials. Furthermore, we would like to create a learning environment for our students that supports a diversity of thoughts, perspectives and experiences, and honors your identities (including race, gender, class, sexuality, religion, ability, etc.) To help accomplish this:If you have a name and/or set of pronouns that differ from those that appear in your official Harvard records, please let us know!</p>
<p>If you feel like your performance in the class is being impacted by your experiences outside of class, please don’t hesitate to come and talk with us. We want to be a resource for you. Remember that you can also submit anonymous feedback (which will lead to me making a general announcement to the class, if necessary to address your concerns). If you prefer to speak with someone outside of the course, you may find helpful resources at the Harvard Office of Diversity and Inclusion.</p>
<p>We (like many people) are still in the process of learning about diverse perspectives and identities. If something was said in class (by anyone) that made you feel uncomfortable, please talk to us about it. (Again, anonymous feedback is always an option.)</p>
<p>As a participant in course discussions, you should also strive to honor the diversity of your classmates.</p>
<h5>**Academic Honesty**</h5>

<p>Ethical behavior is an important trait of a Data Scientist, from ethically handling data to attribution of code and work of others. Thus, in AC209 we give a strong emphasis to Academic Honesty.</p>
<p>As a student your best guidelines are to be reasonable and fair. We encourage teamwork for problem sets and allow submission in pairs for most problem sets, but you should not split the homework and you should work on all the problems together.</p>
